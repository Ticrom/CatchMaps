# CatchMaps CatchMaps is a mobile web application designed to assist anglers in logging fish catches. Catchmaps utilizes the open weather API to determine weather conditions at time and location of catch. Data is logged in MongoDB and stored as user, location, speciesCaught, baitUsed, and timeLogged. A geoJSON will be generated and pushed my MongoDB populating a react element containing a MapBox map. Anglers will easily be able to log and view catches/catch data accurately on a map. Planned implementation for private fishing groups/friends.
